# diceGame
This is a project as a requirement to obtain a certification for web development on udemy.
This website is dice game that mimics two players rolling die to determine the winner (whoever has the highest number on the dice) when a button is clicked.

After structuring with html and styling with css, I added behaviour or function with js. 
I generated two random numbers and assigned them to variables, I also used the random numbers generated to change the die images as the button is clicked.
Then the winner is declared.
